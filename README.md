Booble for Safari!

Enhances the Google Homepage

Because Apple is literally 1984, to use this you have to enable unsigned extensions in Safari (The extension is fully signed and notarized, but end users can only get normal extensions through the App Store, although if you make a Mac app and then add an extension you can circumvent this supposedly).

To do this, go to Safari Preferences -> Furthest right tab -> show developer options in menu bar -> then click on developer on the menu bar -> allow unsigned extensions.

This resets every time you quit Safari... Thanks Apple.
